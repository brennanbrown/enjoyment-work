<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**Enjoyment Work** is an academic / research-focused theme that provides extensive features for note-taking and personal growth. It is based off of the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) philosophy, which you can read more about on the [**demo site**](https://enjoyment-work.netlify.app)

The next step for Enjoyment Work is to properly configure the syntax required to work with [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. Which would ultimately allow somebody to turn their Obsidian notes into an online blog by simply using the `_notes` directory.

There are several other planned features in the [Roadmap](#roadmap) ahead, as the project is far from perfect. It is currently using the Bootstrap 4 framework, which although is powerful and extensive, does slow thing down, along with the rather large `style.css` file which needs to be trimmed down and converted into SASS.

If you like the idea of being able to use Jekyll as a free alternative to Roam Research, Notion, etc. then please feel free to [**use this template**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/generate), or even better, contribute to this project by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/pulls) or [creating an issue](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/issues)! First-time contributors are definitely welcomed!

In addition, I have created three other free Jekyll themes that you might be interested in:

- :potable_water: [**Watery**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery): A minimalist, bare-bones theme for Jekyll only using the Water.css framework while still following the best practices for accessibility and search-engine optimization.
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: [**Purelog**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog): A responsive sidebar Jekyll theme using the Pure.css framework, designed for writers and bloggers of all kinds.
- [**Classic Spirits**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/classic-spirit): A classic sidebar Jekyll theme for old-school blogging, created with the Bulma framework. Built on Soot Spirits by Abhishek Nagekar.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Jekyll requires the following:

- Ruby version **2.5.0** or higher
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make

See [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) for guides and details.

### Instructions

1. Install all [prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install the jekyll and bundler [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems).

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work.git
```

4. Change into your new directory.

```
cd enjoyment-work
```

5. Install gems from the `Gemfile`.

```
bundle install
```

6. Build the site and make it available on a local server.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

7. Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you encounter any errors during this process, check that you have installed all the prerequisites in [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

If you still have issues, see [Troubleshooting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems).

### Continuous Integration

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that builds the site and runs HTMLProofer checks on PRs and pushes. Ensure you run `bundle install` locally after pulling to install the `html-proofer` gem.

## Getting Started

Once you have Jekyll up-and-running, there are only a few steps needed to make this theme your own:

1. Fill out the `_BLANK_config.yml` configuration file and replace the current `_config.yml`
2. Remove the `example_posts` folder in `_posts`, `_notes`, `_journals` and start writing your own!
3. Modify or remove the pages in `_pages` to however you see fit.
4. _(Optional)_ Modify or remove this `README.md` with information about your own project or blog.
5. _(Optional)_ Modify the CSS files in the `assets` folder to customize the site.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

There are several features that I'm still planning to create and integrate, including:

- Optimize and minify stylesheets and design. (SCSS pipeline added; continue trimming legacy CSS, consider reducing Bootstrap.)
- Configure to work with Obsidian out-of-the-box. (Wikilinks supported; add image/file embeds and edge cases.)
- Create a [Theme Gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#publishing-your-theme).
- "Deploy to Netlify" button. (Done.)
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions + HTMLProofer. (Done.)
- Additional documentation for custom collections and auto-generated pages.
- More example posts and articles.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
