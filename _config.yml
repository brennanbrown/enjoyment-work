  "Hey there! My name is Brennan, I'm a 24-year-old Métis web developer and content strategist from Winnipeg,
  Manitoba and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta. I've recently compeleted a Full Stack Developer Program

description: "A Digital Garden: Capturing my daily thoughts and progress, as well as curated ideas with unique synthesis—a personal zettelkasten."
footer_description:
  'The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the
  resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. While not everybody
  has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.'
